# Data Musicalization 2025

This repository contains experimental implementations and research code for **data musicalization**, focusing on methods for generating musical structures and audio output from sound data.  

---

## Overview

**Data musicalization** is an approach that transforms data into musical expressions, extending the concept of sonification toward structured, aesthetic musical output.

This project explores:
- Experimental pipelines for converting audio data into musical representations
- Algorithmic and data-driven approaches to music generation
- Prototypical implementations for research and evaluation purposes

The repository includes source code, generated audio samples, and supporting materials for reproducing experiments.
